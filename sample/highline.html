	  <p>The High Line (also known as the High Line Park) is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33 km) New York City linear park built in Manhattan on an elevated section of a
	  disused New York Central Railroad spur called the West Side Line. Inspired by the 3-mile (4.8-kilometer) Promenade plantée, a similar project in Paris completed
	  in 1993, the High Line has been redesigned and planted as an aerial greenway and rails-to-trails park.</p>

    <p>The High Line Park uses the disused southern portion of the West Side Line running to the Lower West Side of Manhattan. It runs from Gansevoort Street –
    three blocks below 14th Street – in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to the northern edge of the West Side Yard on 34th Street near the Javits
    Convention Center. An unopened spur extends above 30th Street to Tenth Avenue.[5] Formerly, the High Line went as far south as a railroad terminal to
    Spring Street just north of Canal Street, however, most of the lower section was demolished in 1960, with another small portion of the lower section being
    demolished in 1991.</p>
