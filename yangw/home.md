# Welcome

This file is writtem in _markdown_. That is good because:

## Paragraphs

If I want A < B what do I do? What about A & B? And &lt;i>A and B&lt;/i>?

On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen 
saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.

On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, 
participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles.

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

## Links

This is a link to [Google](https://www.google.com/).

I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

[ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/

Not sure how it handles a simple link to [[http://www.google.com/]]

[[fine]](http://www.attacklab.net/)
[[[broken]]](http://www.attacklab.net/)



I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

## Blockquote

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

### Header 3

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.
